Click "Ok" to any of the pop ups
Then windows Activation should be Complete if Done Correctly

Click Mac Changer
Then Enter a Valid Mac Address using the example
dependding on what you change will decide wether you need 02 at the beginning for comatibility with wifi adaptors, lan can be changed to mach the number letter order of the example mac address for example:
LAN:
A44E31CAE7E4
So i could do:
B23D34DED5D7

WIFI:
024E31CAE7E4
So i could do:
023D42EAD6A8
